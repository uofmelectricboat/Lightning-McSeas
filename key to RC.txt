channel

1 - throttle *power output
2 - rudder *ratio of motors and maybe rudders
3 - elevator *rise of front actuators 
4 - aileron *turn of rudder when in I mode
5 - SC *drive mode (D, N, R - only change motors)
6 - S *aft foil mode (I, U, L)
7 - S *battery cutoff 

S1 and S2 can be fine tune adjustments

14 to 29 is values

Add another message since only 4 signals per message and configure in DBC - should just be FF01



------------------------
front t foils sync

dont control yaw - only do pitch (not yaw) - v tail plane controls 

back foils go same as front

-knobs
one knob is gain of front
one knob is gain of back 

------------------------------------------------
right joystick is flap controls
left knob is tfoil controls 


1 - left motor
2 - right motor
3 - rise of back actuators
4 - rise of front actuators (knob)
5 - SC *drive mode (D, x, R - only change motors)
6 - S *foil mode (I, U, L) -freeze actuators or lock
7 - S *battery cutoff (motors shut off before batteries - give delay)
8 - s *motor cutoff 

we switched *** channel 6 and 7 with 10 and 9
 
-also we dont have a foil off mode
